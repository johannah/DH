# Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) parameters for behavior cloning 

Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters are a set of four parameters which allow us to attach reference frames to links in a kinematic chain. We utilize this differentiable formulation for improving transfer in behavior cloning between robots with the same or different kinematic configurations. 

## train a new RL model:

`python train_rl.py --cfg experiments/base_dm.cfg`

## evaluate and plot the latest model from a training directory:  

`python train_rl.py --eval --frames --load_model results/base_easy_01111_reacher_1_00/ --frames`

This will result in plots for reward & target position, and a video of the episodes written as a derivitive of the most recent .pt file in the --load_model directory. 

## evaluate and plot a specific model:

`python train_rl.py --eval --frames --load_model results/base_easy_01111_reacher_1_00/base_0000355000.pt`

---

# train a behavior cloning model which predicts relative JOINT_POSITIONS for a given state 
 

### with DH on the end effector or target link:

`python train_bc.py --load_replay <path-to-rl-eval-replay-buffer>.pkl`

### on the joint angles:

`python train_bc.py --load_replay <path-to-rl-eval-replay-buffer>.pkl --loss "angle"`


## now plot and evaluate the behavior cloning 
### NOTE: This is not really relevant with dm_control - but used with robosuite and JOINT_POSITION controller

`python train_bc.py --load_model <path-to-saved-bc-model> --eval --frames`


# Adding Robot Configurations to dm_control 

We utilize some non-standard dm_control robots for experiments. To work with these, copy the contents of the "robots" directory to your dm_control installation: 

```
cd DH
cp robots/dm_control/*.* ../dm_control/dm_control/suite/ 
cd ../dm_control 
pip install .
```
Then you can experiment with these models as you would other robots. 

For instance, to train an rl reacher agent with links which are double the size of the standard reacher: 

```
cd DH
python train_rl.py --cfg experiments/reacher_double.cfg
```
